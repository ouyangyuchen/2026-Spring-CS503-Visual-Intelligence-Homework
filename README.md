# CS503 2026 Spring – Homework Repository

Welcome to the CS503 homework repository. This repository contains all homework and tutorial materials used throughout the course.

## Repository structure

1. [Transformer_Homework](/Transformer_Homework)
   - Homework 1: introduction to transformer architectures for sequence modeling.

2. [NanoFM_Homeworks](/NanoFM_Homeworks)
   - Homework 2: `nanoGPT` and `nanoMaskGIT` — small-scale implementations of GPT-style language modeling and MaskGIT-style image token modeling.
   - Homework 3: `nano4M` — a small-scale implementation of 4M-style multi-modal model.
   - Homework 4: `nanoVLM` and `nanoFlowMatching` (to be released) — vision-language modeling and flow-matching based generative modeling.
   - This folder also includes environment setup scripts, cluster submission scripts, and training utilities shared across the NanoFM homeworks.

In addition, we provide several tutorials:

1. [Cluster_Tutorial](/Cluster_Tutorial): overview of the two main compute resources used in this course ([SCITAS](/Cluster_Tutorial/scitas_tutorial.md) and [GNOTO](/Cluster_Tutorial/gnoto_Tutorial/gnoto_tutorial.md)) and how to run jobs on them. We **recommend** running the Transformer homework on GNOTO and the NanoFM homeworks on SCITAS.
- [SCITAS_Tutorial](/Cluster_Tutorial/scitas_tutorial.md): detailed instructions for running interactive and batch jobs on SCITAS (Izar).
- [GNOTO_Tutorial](/Cluster_Tutorial/gnoto_Tutorial/gnoto_tutorial.md): detailed guide for running in a JupyterLab-based environment (GNOTO).
2. [PyTorch_Tutorial](/PyTorch_Tutorial): a brief PyTorch refresher for those not familiar with PyTorch (*however, we do not recommend taking this course if this is your first time using PyTorch*). The tutorial will not be graded.

**Important note on compute resources:** GPU resources are limited and shared across the class. **Do not wait until the last day** to start or finish your homework. If you cannot obtain GPUs due to last-minute congestion, this will **not** be accepted as a valid reason for late submission or deadline extension.
